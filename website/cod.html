            <h2>Call of Duty: Black Ops 3</h2>
            <p>
            <b>Release date:</b> November 6th 2015
            <br/>
            <b>Publisher:</b> Activision
            <br/>
            <b>Developers:</b> Treyarch, Beenox, Raven Software, Mercenary Technology
            </p>
            <h3>
                The Story
            </h3>
            <p>
            The six-hour story is set in the not-too-distant future, and, like most similar sci-fi fare, it includes its own techno-gibberish to get used to.
            Black Ops 3 settles on “Direct Neural Interface,” or DNI for short. This ubiquitous technology allows humans to mentally interact with computers, weapons, and other people.
            It introduces both terrific new abilities and important new limitations that changed the way I thought about playing Call of Duty.
            For example, you can’t use enemies’ dropped weapons because they’re registered to someone else’s brain – hence Black Ops 3’s focus on cool new combat powers.
            <br/><br/>
            Without going into too much detail so I don't give away any spoilers, the character development was quite dissapointing, as whenever I'm just starting to actually care about character, Treyarch just come in and give em the chop.
            Because of this, whenever a character does get hacked off, I struggle to actually care and I just sit there with a "meh" look on my face. Despite this, the story itself is rather quite interesting.
            It delves into topics about how future technology wil affect society as a whole, and whether an advance in technology is actually beneficial to the human race.
            For instance, what happens when people can no longer control their own thoughts? What happens if our technological enhancements can be used against us?
            Well, the answer is to blow up robots, a LOT of robots. Just when you think the story is picking up, it drops you into the midst of action doing the same thing, over, and over, and over again, with small exceptions here and there.
            This wouldn't necessarily be a terrible thing if the gameplay was varied and fun, and in Black Ops 3's case, the gameplay is exactly that.
            </p>
            <h3>
                The Gameplay
            </h3>
            <p>
            Luckily, killing the same enemies for almost the entire game isn't as boring as you might think, due to the new powers you are given to use throughout the entire campaign.
            These powers come in three different types: blow stuff up, beat stuff up, or control your enemies so they can do the dirty work for you.
            Each of these powers come with their own upgrade tree, and allows you to upgrade to really vary your tactics to complete stages in the game.
            You unlock these points you earn by progressing through the campaign. You can get these faster by performing more melee kills, headshots, grenade kills etc.
            You won't be able to get enough points to unlock all upgrades on your first playthrough without having to sacrifice perks, weapon upgrades and extra grenades, as the campaign comes with its own Create-a-Class system similar to the mulitplayer
            Having to sacrifice such upgrades won't be much of a problem, as customizing your gun is usually the way you want to spend your upgrade points, as the weapon you customized will most likely stay with you the entire game.
            This sort of gameplay has never been seen before in a Call of Duty game, and I think it was an excellent decision.
            <br/><br/>
            However, I believe the best decision made for the single player experience was brining back co-op campaign, which was last seen in World at War.
            Co-op campaign is what the fans have been asking for ever sinced it was introduced in World at Wat, and Treyarch finally delivered.
            You can play the campaign with a maxmimum of 4-players and as is the case with almost all games, it's always better to play with friends.
            </p>
            <h3>
                The Multiplayer
            </h3>
            <p>
            Now, onto the good part. The multiplayer. Call of Duty has always been about the extensive and addictive multiplayer, and always will be.
            Treyarch has kept the classic Pick 10 system, which has been seen in the Black Ops series since Black Ops 2, and is a solid system to use.
            People can't simply just pick all of the good attachmeents and perks and be a god on the battlefield, they must choose wisely.
            <br/><br/>
            With the previous installment of Call of Duty, Advanced Warfare, it set the new standard of movement for the franchise,as Treyarch has taken the exo suit idea and reformed into a much less chatoic and more enjoyable movement system.
            Because let's face it, the Advanced Warfare exo suit system was down right annoying. So what Treyarch has done to fix it is to have a more dynamic movement system instead.
            Rather than having an exo suit, players now have a thruster pack. This enables players to hold the jump button to gradually thrust in any direction whilst in the air, allowing them to get to higher ground without the anooyance of jumping around like a kangaroo.
            Along with this, players can wallride along walls of multiplayer maps. You may not think it, but this drastically changes the way you can play multiplayer. For instance, there are some routes in multiplayer maps that you can only take by traversing across walls, enabling a good flank on the enemy team.
            And even better, you can shoot while wallriding too, which rewards players with a deadshot aim.
            <br/><br/>
            Probably the most exciting thing about the multiplayer experience is the new specialist mechanic. Before the start of every multiplayer match, you get to a pick from a set of 10 specialists.
            Each one of these specialists is unique in their own way. For each specialist, you can either use their ability or their weapon.
            Their abilities are more tactical and objective based, whilst the weapons are more offensive and close-quarters.
            The best part about this specialists is that they add the much needed variety and change the Call of Duty series has been lacking for so long.
            I also love how Treyarch has given each specialist their own personality and even their own backstory.
            </p>
            <h3>
                The Verdict
            </h3>
            <p>
            Overall, Black Ops 3 is a cast improvement to both the previous iteration of the Black Ops series, doing what Advanced Warfare did but better, by improving the movement system to be less annoying to work with, and making the franchise less stale, which is the criticism the franchise has been getting as of late.
            Because of this, I give Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 an easy 9/10
            </p>
